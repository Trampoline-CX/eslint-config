# Publish a new version

We use `release-please` (see @https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to perform the automatic version updates and release of the new version to NPM.

When pushing the latest codes containing releasable units (commits prefixed with `feat` and `fix`) to the `main` branch, a release PR is created. Once this release PR is merged, a new version, along with the corresponding changelog, will be published.

As `release-please` uses the Conventional Commit messages to generate release PRs, make sure to follow the Comventional Commits specification (see @https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
